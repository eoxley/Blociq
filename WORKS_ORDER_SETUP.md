# Works Order System Setup
_Date: January 15, 2025_

## üéØ Goal
When replying to a communal maintenance request and you say you'll arrange a contractor, Ask BlocIQ suggests "Generate works order". Clicking it builds the email with the property address in the subject, access details in the body, and either creates an Outlook draft (Inbox flow) or returns Subject/Body text (Chat flow).

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. **Communal Issue Detector**: `lib/logic/communal.ts`
- **Purpose**: Detect when maintenance requests are for communal areas
- **Features**:
  - Identifies communal vs private issues
  - Detects trade types (electrician, plumber, lift, etc.)
  - Uses keyword matching for accurate detection

### 2. **Works Order Email Builder**: `lib/email/templates/worksOrder.ts`
- **Purpose**: Generate professional works order emails
- **Features**:
  - Property address in subject line
  - Structured body with issue summary, access details, instructions
  - Resident contact information
  - Attachment references

### 3. **Outlook Graph Helper**: `lib/outlook/graph.ts`
- **Purpose**: Create Outlook drafts via Microsoft Graph
- **Features**:
  - Delegated token support
  - Draft creation with webLink for opening in OWA
  - Error handling and fallbacks

### 4. **Works Order API**: `app/api/works-order/prepare/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Prepare works order emails and create Outlook drafts
- **Features**:
  - Supports both Inbox (Outlook draft) and Chat (text) flows
  - Handles missing contractor emails gracefully
  - Returns structured response with mode indication

### 5. **Optional Audit Table**: `supabase/migrations/20250115000004_create_works_orders_table.sql`
- **Purpose**: Log generated works orders for improvement
- **Features**:
  - Tracks building, source, trade, contractor
  - Indexed for efficient querying

### 6. **Suggestion Helper**: `lib/suggestions/worksOrder.ts`
- **Purpose**: Add works order suggestions to AI responses
- **Features**:
  - Context-aware suggestion generation
  - Trade-specific labeling
  - High confidence scoring

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (Optional)
Run this in your Supabase SQL editor if you want audit logging:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250115000004_create_works_orders_table.sql
-- Apply this migration to add works_orders audit table
```

### Step 2: Wire Outlook Token Lookup
Edit `lib/outlook/graph.ts` and implement `getAccessTokenForUser()`:
```typescript
export async function getAccessTokenForUser(userId?: string) {
  // Replace this with your existing Outlook/MSAL token store
  // Example: return await lookupMsalToken(userId);
  // Example: return await getOutlookToken(userId);
  
  // For now, this will fall back to text mode
  throw new Error("Outlook token lookup not implemented. Wire this to your existing Outlook integration.");
}
```

### Step 3: Add to Suggestions API
In your suggestions API route (usually `app/api/ask/suggestions/route.ts`), add:

```typescript
import { maybeAddWorksOrderSuggestion } from "@/lib/suggestions/worksOrder";

// After you computed `suggestions` from the model:
suggestions = maybeAddWorksOrderSuggestion(suggestions, conversationTailText, context);
return NextResponse.json({ suggestions });
```

### Step 4: Add UI Click Handler
In your chat or inbox UI, add the click handler:

```typescript
async function onGenerateWorksOrder(suggestion: any) {
  const r = await fetch("/api/works-order/prepare", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type":"application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ payload: suggestion.payload })
  });
  const j = await r.json();

  if (j.mode === "outlook_draft" && j.draft?.webLink) {
    window.open(j.draft.webLink, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer");
  } else {
    // Show a modal with Subject/Body and "Copy" buttons
    // j.subject, j.body, j.to
    showEmailModal(j.subject, j.body, j.to);
  }
}
```

## üîç How It Works

### Detection Flow
1. **User types**: "We'll arrange an electrician to attend as soon as possible."
2. **System detects**: 
   - Communal issue (contains "communal" words)
   - Trade hint: "electrician" (from keywords)
   - User commitment: "arrange" + "contractor/engineer"
3. **Suggestion appears**: "Generate works order (electrician)"

### Email Generation
```typescript
// Example generated email
Subject: "123 Main Street ‚Äî electrician works order"

Body:
Please attend as soon as feasible to diagnose and report on the issue at 123 Main Street.

Summary of issue (from resident/report):
‚Ä¢ We'll arrange an electrician to attend as soon as possible.

Access & site notes:
‚Ä¢ Access via main entrance, contact building manager

Instructions:
‚Ä¢ Attend and diagnose; provide written report and quotation if remedial works are required. Do not proceed beyond diagnosis without written instruction.

Please confirm ETA and any access/parts requirements.

Kind regards
```

### Flow Modes
- **Inbox Flow**: Creates Outlook draft, opens in OWA
- **Chat Flow**: Returns text for manual copy/paste
- **Fallback**: Returns text if Outlook token unavailable

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Communal Electrician Issue
**Input**: "The communal lighting in the stairwell is not working. We'll arrange an electrician to attend."
**Expected**: "Generate works order (electrician)" suggestion

### Test Case 2: Private Issue (Should Not Trigger)
**Input**: "The light in my kitchen is not working. We'll arrange an electrician."
**Expected**: No works order suggestion (private issue)

### Test Case 3: No Commitment (Should Not Trigger)
**Input**: "The communal lighting is not working."
**Expected**: No works order suggestion (no contractor commitment)

### Test Case 4: Different Trade
**Input**: "There's a leak in the communal corridor. We'll arrange a plumber."
**Expected**: "Generate works order (plumber)" suggestion

## üìä Supported Trades

The system detects these trade types:
- **electrician**: light, lighting, emergency light, fuse, breaker, socket
- **lift**: lift, elevator, stuck, cab, landing button
- **plumber**: leak, water ingress, drip, pipe, overflow, toilet
- **drainage**: gully, drain, manhole, sewer, blocked
- **roofer**: roof, gutter, downpipe, soffit, fascia, flashing
- **fire**: alarm, smoke detector, call point, fire door
- **door**: entrance door, communal door, intercom, fob, access control
- **cleaning**: communal area, spill, glass, litter, bin store
- **decorator**: paint, scuff, decoration, stain
- **grounds**: landscaping, garden, hedge, lawn, car park

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Trade Keywords
Edit `lib/logic/communal.ts` to add/modify trade keywords:
```typescript
const TRADE_KEYWORDS: Record<string, string[]> = {
  electrician: ["light", "lighting", "emergency light", "eml", "fuse", "breaker", "rcd", "socket"],
  // Add your custom trades here
  security: ["cctv", "camera", "security system", "access control"],
};
```

### Customizing Email Template
Edit `lib/email/templates/worksOrder.ts` to modify the email format:
```typescript
export function buildWorksOrderEmail(opts: {
  // ... existing parameters
  custom_instructions?: string; // Add custom field
}) {
  // Modify the email structure as needed
}
```

## üöÄ Environment & Permissions

### Required Graph Scopes
- **Mail.ReadWrite** (for creating drafts)
- **Mail.Send** (optional, for sending directly)

### Outlook Integration
Ensure your existing Outlook integration has:
- Delegated access tokens
- Proper error handling
- Token refresh logic

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Optional Audit Logging
If you applied the migration, you can track usage:
```sql
-- View recent works orders
SELECT 
  trade_hint,
  source,
  building_id,
  created_at
FROM public.works_orders
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Most common trades
SELECT 
  trade_hint,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.works_orders
GROUP BY trade_hint
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Track suggestion accuracy
- Monitor Outlook draft creation success rate
- Analyze user adoption of works order feature

## üßπ Cleanup (Optional)

### Remove Optional Components:
```bash
# Remove audit table migration if not needed
rm supabase/migrations/20250115000004_create_works_orders_table.sql

# Remove suggestion helper if not using suggestions API
rm lib/suggestions/worksOrder.ts
```

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Tests

### Test 1: Chat Flow
1. Reply to communal issue: "We'll arrange an electrician to attend as soon as possible."
2. Click "Generate works order (electrician)"
3. Verify: Returns Subject/Body text with property address

### Test 2: Inbox Flow (with Outlook token)
1. Same input as above
2. Click suggestion
3. Verify: Opens Outlook draft in OWA

### Test 3: Fallback (no Outlook token)
