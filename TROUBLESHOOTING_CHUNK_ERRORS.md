# Troubleshooting Chunk Loading Errors

## What are Chunk Loading Errors?

Chunk loading errors occur when Next.js fails to load JavaScript chunks (code bundles) that are split for performance optimization. These errors typically manifest as:

```
Uncaught ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk X failed.
(error: https://yourdomain.com/_next/static/chunks/chunk-name.js)
```

## Common Causes

1. **Build Cache Issues**: Corrupted or outdated build cache
2. **Import Errors**: Missing or incorrect imports in code
3. **Network Issues**: CDN or hosting provider problems
4. **Version Mismatches**: Incompatible package versions
5. **Large Bundle Sizes**: Chunks that are too large to load efficiently

## Quick Fixes

### 1. Clear Cache and Rebuild (Recommended First Step)

```bash
npm run clear-cache
```

This script will:
- Remove the `.next` directory
- Clear npm cache
- Reinstall dependencies
- Rebuild the project

### 2. Manual Cache Clearing

If the script doesn't work, try these steps manually:

```bash
# Remove build cache
rmdir /s /q .next

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

### 3. Check for Import Errors

Look for console warnings during build:
```bash
npm run build
```

Common import issues to fix:
- Missing exports from modules
- Incorrect import paths
- Circular dependencies

### 4. Update Dependencies

```bash
# Update all dependencies
npm update

# Or update specific packages
npm update next react react-dom
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Optimize Bundle Size

The project is configured with:
- Webpack chunk splitting optimization
- Package import optimization for large libraries
- CSS optimization

### 2. Monitor Bundle Size

Check the build output for large chunks:
```bash
npm run build
```

Look for chunks larger than 500KB and consider:
- Code splitting
- Dynamic imports
- Tree shaking

### 3. Use Dynamic Imports

For large components, use dynamic imports:

```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>
})
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance

- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for deprecated packages
- Regular cache clearing
- Check for TypeScript/ESLint errors

## Production Deployment

### 1. Vercel Deployment

For Vercel deployments:
- Ensure build completes successfully
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are set

### 2. Custom Server

For custom servers:
- Ensure proper static file serving
- Check CORS configuration
- Verify cache headers

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console

Look for:
- Network errors (404, 500)
- JavaScript syntax errors
- Missing dependencies

### 2. Check Network Tab

In browser dev tools:
- Look for failed chunk requests
- Check response status codes
- Verify chunk URLs are correct

### 3. Check Build Output

```bash
npm run build
```

Look for:
- Warnings about large chunks
- Import/export errors
- Missing dependencies

## Environment-Specific Issues

### Development Environment

- Use `npm run dev` with Turbopack for faster builds
- Clear cache more frequently during development
- Monitor for hot reload issues

### Production Environment

- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Check CDN configuration
- Monitor for memory issues

## When to Contact Support

Contact support if:
- Errors persist after all troubleshooting steps
- Errors occur in production only
- Large chunks are causing performance issues
- Import errors cannot be resolved
