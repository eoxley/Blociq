# Leaseholder Portal Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete leaseholder portal has been implemented for BlocIQ with authentication, access control, AI chat, contact forms, and live financial data integration.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Leaseholder Authentication
- **Extended profiles table** with role constraint: `'manager','staff','leaseholder','director'`
- **Created leaseholder_users join table** linking auth.users to leaseholders
- **Built invite flow** with magic links via Supabase Auth Admin
- **First-time login linking** automatically connects users to their leaseholder records
- **Portal access control** through middleware and RLS policies

### 2. Access Control / RLS
- **Updated RLS policies** for leaseholder-specific data access
- **Portal access functions**:
  - `portal_has_lease_access(user_id, lease_id)` - Leaseholders can only see their own lease
  - `portal_has_building_access(user_id, building_id)` - Directors can see all building leases
- **Applied to tables**: leases, units, communications_log, building_documents, compliance_documents
- **Middleware protection** blocks `/portal/*` unless role = leaseholder OR director

### 3. Routes & Features

#### `/portal/[leaseholderId]/chat`
- **Leaseholder-facing AI assistant** (AskBlocIQ)
- **Scoped to lease + building context**
- **Example prompts**:
  - "What's my current service charge balance?"
  - "Show me last year's accounts"
  - "How do I report a leak?"
- **Context-aware responses** using lease and building data

#### `/portal/[leaseholderId]/contact`
- **Simple contact form** with category and urgency selection
- **Posts to communications_log** with proper metadata
- **Sends notifications** to building managers
- **Fixed help/contact links** in navigation

### 4. Portal UI Updates
- **Live finance data** from `ar_demand_headers` + `ar_receipts` tables
- **Updated Account page** showing:
  - Balance breakdown (arrears vs payments)
  - Upcoming demand schedule
- **Badge indicators**:
  - "In Arrears" (if balance > 0)
  - "Up to Date" (if balance = 0)
- **Replaced all placeholders** with real data

### 5. Error Handling
- **Enabled middleware** for portal routes
- **Error pages**: `/portal/access-denied`, proper error handling
- **Redirect unauthorized** → `/portal/access-denied`
- **Comprehensive error messages** in all API responses

### 6. Unit Tests
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering:
  - Invite leaseholder → first login links to lease
  - Leaseholder can view only their own data
  - Director can view all leases in building
  - Unauthorized staff/manager cannot access portal
  - Chat route pulls correct building/lease context
  - Contact form logs to communications_log

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Tables
1. **leaseholder_users** - Links auth.users to leaseholders
2. **ar_demand_headers** - Payment demands for leaseholders
3. **ar_receipts** - Payment receipts from leaseholders
4. **notification_queue** - Email notification queue
5. **ai_interactions_log** - AI chat interaction logging

### Updated Tables
- **profiles** - Added role constraint with leaseholder support
- **leaseholders** - Added portal_enabled, last_portal_access columns

### RLS Policies
- **Leaseholder-specific access** - Can only see their own lease data
- **Director access** - Can see all leases in their buildings
- **Staff/Manager access** - Can see leases in their agency buildings
- **Portal-specific policies** for all relevant tables
