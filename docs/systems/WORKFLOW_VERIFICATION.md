# Onboarding Workflow Verification

## ✅ Implementation Matches Specification

Our implementation perfectly matches the requested workflow:

### 1. Super Admin Upload ✅
**Specification**: Super_admin uploads client pack (dropzone)
**Implementation**: 
- `/dashboard/onboarding` with dropzone interface
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Supports client packs (PDF, Excel, Word, TXT, CSV)
- Files stored in Supabase Storage
- Metadata saved to `onboarding_raw` table

### 2. AI Classification + Extraction ✅
**Specification**: AI runs classification + extraction (`/api/onboarding/extract`)
**Implementation**:
- `/api/onboarding/extract` endpoint
- Document type classification (lease, FRA, apportionment, etc.)
- Text extraction from various file formats
- Data structuring to appropriate production tables
- Confidence scoring and validation
- Results stored in `staging_structured` table

### 3. Super Admin Review ✅
**Specification**: Super_admin reviews in `/dashboard/onboarding`
**Implementation**:
- Two-panel dashboard layout
- Raw Uploads panel for file management
- Staging Review panel for AI-extracted data
- Accept/Edit/Reject functionality
- File preview and confidence indicators

### 4. Accept → Production Commit ✅
**Specification**: Accept → data written into buildings, units, etc.
**Implementation**:
- Accept button triggers automatic commit
- Data validation and cleaning
- Insert into production tables (buildings, units, leaseholders, leases, etc.)
- Status updates and audit trail
- `/api/onboarding/commit` endpoint for batch operations

### 5. Clean Production Tables ✅
**Specification**: Agencies/clients only ever see clean production tables
**Implementation**:
- RLS policies restrict staging tables to super_admin only
- Production tables contain only validated, accepted data
- No AI confidence scores or processing metadata in production
- Standard BlocIQ interface for agencies/clients

## Security Verification

### Access Control ✅
```sql
-- Only super_admin can access staging tables
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can manage onboarding_raw" ON public.onboarding_raw
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can manage staging_structured" ON public.staging_structured
CREATE POLICY "Super admins can manage onboarding_batches" ON public.onboarding_batches
```

### Role Verification ✅
```typescript
// Dashboard access control
if (profileError || !profile || profile.role !== 'super_admin') {
  setUnauthorized(true);
  return;
}
```

### Production Isolation ✅
- Staging tables (`onboarding_raw`, `staging_structured`) → Super admin only
- Production tables (`buildings`, `units`, etc.) → Standard agency/client access
- No cross-contamination between staging and production data

## API Endpoint Verification

### Complete Workflow Endpoints ✅
1. **POST** `/api/onboarding/upload` - File upload and storage
2. **POST** `/api/onboarding/extract` - AI classification and extraction
3. **POST** `/api/onboarding/review` - Accept/reject/edit actions
4. **POST** `/api/onboarding/commit` - Production table insertion
5. **GET** endpoints for listing and querying data

### Error Handling ✅
- File validation and size limits
- AI processing error recovery
- Production constraint validation
- User-friendly error messages

## Data Flow Verification

### Upload Phase ✅
```
Super Admin → Dropzone → Supabase Storage → onboarding_raw table
```

### Processing Phase ✅
```
Raw File → AI Analysis → staging_structured table
```

### Review Phase ✅
```
AI Extracted Data → Human Review → Accept/Edit/Reject Decision
```

### Commit Phase ✅
```
Accepted Data → Validation → Production Tables → Audit Log
```

### Final State ✅
```
Production Tables: buildings, units, leaseholders, leases, etc.
Contains: Only clean, validated, accepted data
```

## Quality Assurance Features

### AI Confidence Scoring ✅
- Visual indicators (Green ≥80%, Yellow 60-79%, Red <60%)
- Helps super admins prioritize review efforts
- Not exposed to agencies/clients

### Data Validation ✅
- Required field checking
- Data type validation
- Business rule enforcement
- Foreign key relationship validation

### Audit Trail ✅
- Upload tracking with timestamps
- Processing history with confidence scores
- Review decisions with notes
- Production commit records

## Benefits Delivered

### For Super Admins
- ✅ Efficient AI-powered processing
- ✅ Quality control through human review
- ✅ Bulk operations and batch management
- ✅ Complete audit capability

### For Agencies/Clients
- ✅ Clean, validated data only
- ✅ Standard BlocIQ interface
- ✅ Immediate data availability
- ✅ Trust and reliability

### For the Platform
- ✅ Scalable AI processing
- ✅ High data quality standards
- ✅ Clear security boundaries
- ✅ Regulatory compliance

## Conclusion

The implementation perfectly matches the specified workflow:

1. ✅ **Super_admin uploads client pack (dropzone)**
2. ✅ **AI runs classification + extraction (`/api/onboarding/extract`)**
3. ✅ **Super_admin reviews in `/dashboard/onboarding`**
4. ✅ **Accept → data written into buildings, units, etc.**
5. ✅ **Agencies/clients only ever see clean production tables**

The system provides a robust, secure, and efficient onboarding process that maintains the highest data quality standards while keeping the complexity hidden from end users.
