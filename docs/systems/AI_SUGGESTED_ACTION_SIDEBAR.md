# AI Suggested Action Sidebar for BlocIQ Inbox

## Overview

The AI Suggested Action Sidebar is a smart assistant that automatically analyzes incoming emails and provides property managers with intelligent suggestions for next actions. It appears as a right-hand sidebar in the email detail view (`/inbox/[id]`) and helps streamline email handling workflows.

## Features

- **Template Matching**: Suggests relevant document templates when appropriate

### ðŸŽ¯ Action Types
The AI categorizes suggested actions into these types:

1. **Generate Template** (`generate_template`)
   - When a specific document/letter should be generated
   - Links directly to template creation with prefilled data
   - Examples: Service charge letters, maintenance notices, legal documents

2. **Reply** (`reply`)
   - When a direct email reply is needed

   - Navigates to task creation with prefilled information
   - Links email context to the task

4. **Escalate** (`escalate`)

   - Marks email as escalated in the system
   - Updates status and handling information

5. **Archive** (`archive`)
   - When no action is needed
   - Moves email to archived folder
   - Marks as handled

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

## Database Schema

### New Fields Added to `incoming_emails` Table

```sql
-- AI-generated tags for email categorization
tags TEXT[] 

-- AI-generated summary of email content
ai_summary TEXT

-- AI-suggested next action for this email
suggested_action TEXT

-- Type of suggested action
suggested_action_type TEXT

-- Template ID to use if suggested action is generate_template
suggested_template_id UUID REFERENCES templates(id)

-- Unit ID if email is related to a specific unit

```

### Indexes for Performance
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_incoming_emails_tags ON incoming_emails USING GIN(tags);
CREATE INDEX idx_incoming_emails_suggested_action_type ON incoming_emails(suggested_action_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_incoming_emails_ai_analyzed_at ON incoming_emails(ai_analyzed_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_incoming_emails_suggested_template_id ON incoming_emails(suggested_template_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_incoming_emails_related_unit_id ON incoming_emails(related_unit_id);
```

## Integration Points

### Email Sync Process
The email sync process (`/api/sync-emails`) automatically triggers AI analysis for newly synced emails:

```typescript
// After successfully inserting email
if (!error) {
  // Trigger AI analysis asynchronously
  fetch('/api/analyze-email', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ messageId: email.message_id })
  })
}
```

### Email Detail Page
The email detail page (`/inbox/[id]`) now includes:

1. **Two-column layout**: Email content on left, AI sidebar on right
2. **Updated interface**: Includes AI analysis fields
3. **Action integration**: Sidebar actions trigger appropriate responses

### Reply Modal Integration
When the sidebar suggests a "reply" action, it can trigger the existing reply modal with context.

## AI Analysis Process

### 1. Context Building
The AI analysis considers:
- Email content (subject, body, sender)
- Building context (if related to a specific building)
- Unit context (if related to a specific unit)
- Property management domain knowledge

### 2. Analysis Steps
1. **Tag Generation**: Categorizes email with relevant tags
2. **Summary Creation**: Creates concise summary of content
3. **Action Recommendation**: Suggests best next action
4. **Template Matching**: Finds relevant templates if needed
5. **Context Linking**: Links to related units/buildings

### 3. AI Prompt Structure
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert property management AI assistant specializing in UK leasehold block management. Your job is to analyze incoming emails and provide:

1. **Tags**: Categorize the email with relevant tags
2. **Summary**: Provide a concise 2-3 sentence summary
3. **Suggested Action**: Recommend the best next action
4. **Action Type**: Categorize the suggested action

Return your response as a valid JSON object.`;
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Service Charge Query
**Email**: "Hi, the service charge budget seems too high this year."

**AI Analysis**:
- Tags: `["service charge", "finance"]`
- Summary: "Leaseholder is concerned about high service charge"
- Suggested Action: "Reply with explanation and attach Budget Letter"
- Action Type: `generate_template`

**User Action**: Click "Generate Document" â†’ Opens budget letter template

### Example 2: Maintenance Request
**Email**: "The heating in Flat 7 isn't working properly."

**AI Analysis**:
- Tags: `["maintenance", "heating"]`
- Summary: "Heating system issue reported in Flat 7"
- Suggested Action: "Create maintenance task for heating repair"
- Action Type: `raise_task`

**User Action**: Click "Create Task" â†’ Opens task creation with prefilled data

### Example 3: Legal Notice
**Email**: "We need to serve a Section 20 notice for major works."

**AI Analysis**:
- Tags: `["legal", "major works"]`
- Summary: "Legal notice required for major works project"

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- AI analysis is triggered asynchronously to avoid blocking email sync
- Analysis results are cached in the database
- Re-analysis is available but not automatic
- Indexes optimize query performance

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when AI analysis fails
- Manual re-analysis option available
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Non-blocking design for email sync

### Security
- AI analysis uses existing OpenAI API key
- No sensitive data sent to AI (only email content)
- Database updates use service role key
- User permissions respected for actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Analysis Not Appearing**
   - Check if email sync completed successfully
   - Verify OpenAI API key is configured
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Try manual re-analysis

2. **Actions Not Working**
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Check user permissions
   - Ensure database schema is updated
   - Review network requests in browser

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check database indexes are created
   - Monitor OpenAI API response times
   - Verify async processing is working
   - Review server logs for bottlenecks

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by setting `NODE_ENV=development` to see detailed error messages and API responses.

## Conclusion

The AI Suggested Action Sidebar transforms BlocIQ's inbox from a simple email viewer into an intelligent operations assistant. By automatically analyzing emails and suggesting appropriate actions, it significantly reduces the time property managers spend on routine email handling while ensuring consistent, high-quality responses.

The feature is designed to be non-intrusive, providing helpful suggestions without forcing specific workflows, and can be easily extended with additional action types and integrations as needed.
