# OCR Integration with Ask BlocIQ

## Overview

The OCR microservice has been successfully integrated with the existing Ask BlocIQ file upload system. This integration provides automatic text extraction from uploaded documents before sending them to the AI for analysis.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `useAIConversation` Hook

The `hooks/useAIConversation.ts` file has been updated with:

- **OCR Processing**: Files are automatically processed through the OCR microservice at `https://ocr-server-2-ykmk.onrender.com/upload`
- **Enhanced Message Interface**: Added `files`, `ocrStatus`, and `ocrText` properties to track OCR processing
- **Lease Document Analysis**: Special handling for lease documents with comprehensive compliance checklist
- **Smart Content Enhancement**: OCR text is intelligently integrated into AI prompts

### 2. OCR Processing Function

```typescript
async function processFileWithOCR(file: File): Promise<{ text: string; success: boolean; error?: string }>
```

- Calls the external OCR microservice
- Handles errors gracefully
- Returns structured results for success/failure

### 3. Lease Document Enhancement

For lease documents, the AI prompt automatically includes:

- **Property Details Summary**
- **Financial Obligations Analysis**
- **Compliance Checklist** with Y/N answers for:
  - Term Consent
  - Reserve Fund
  - Windows/Pipes/Heating
  - Parking
  - Right of Access
  - TV/Assignment/Alterations
  - Notice Requirements
  - Sublet/Pets
  - Debt Recovery/Interest
  - Exterior/Interior Decorations

### 4. Enhanced AIAssistantClient

The `app/ai-assistant/AIAssistantClient.tsx` has been updated to:

- Display OCR processing status in real-time
- Show file information with processing indicators
- Maintain existing UI patterns while adding OCR functionality

## How It Works

### File Upload Flow

1. **User uploads file(s)** → Files are added to the conversation
2. **OCR Processing** → Each file is sent to the OCR microservice
3. **Content Enhancement** → OCR text is integrated into the AI prompt
4. **AI Analysis** → Enhanced prompt is sent to the AI service
5. **Response Display** → AI response includes document analysis

### OCR Status Tracking

- **Processing**: "⏳ Processing..." - OCR is running
- **Completed**: "✅ OCR Complete" - OCR finished successfully
- **Failed**: "❌ OCR Failed" - OCR encountered an error

### Lease Document Detection

Files are automatically detected as lease documents if they contain:
- "lease" in the filename
- "agreement" in the filename  
- "tenancy" in the filename

## API Integration

### OCR Microservice Endpoint

```
POST https://ocr-server-2-ykmk.onrender.com/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: FormData with 'file' field
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "text": "Extracted text content",
  "success": true
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Graceful fallback with user notification
- **OCR Failures**: Continues processing with original content
- **File Size Limits**: Maintains existing file validation
- **Service Unavailable**: Falls back to standard processing

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Text Extraction**: No manual OCR processing required
2. **Enhanced AI Responses**: Better context from extracted text
3. **Lease Document Intelligence**: Specialized analysis for property documents
4. **Real-time Status**: Users see processing progress
5. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing file upload UI

## Technical Details

### File Types Supported

- PDF documents
- Image files (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Word documents
- Text files

### Processing Limits

- OCR text is truncated to 8000 characters for lease documents
- OCR text is truncated to 2000 characters for other documents
- Maintains existing file size limits

### Memory Management

- OCR results are stored in message state
- No persistent storage of OCR text
- Efficient memory usage for conversation history

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously
2. **OCR Quality Metrics**: Show confidence scores
3. **Language Support**: Multi-language OCR processing
4. **Document Type Detection**: Automatic classification
5. **OCR Caching**: Store results for repeated uploads

## Testing

The integration has been tested with:
- ✅ Text file uploads
- ✅ PDF document processing
- ✅ Image file OCR
- ✅ Lease document enhancement
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ UI status updates

## Maintenance

- Monitor OCR service availability
- Track processing success rates
- Update lease document detection patterns as needed
- Review AI prompt effectiveness
- Monitor performance metrics

## Support

For issues with the OCR integration:
1. Check OCR service status at the microservice endpoint
2. Verify file format and size requirements
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Review network requests in browser dev tools
