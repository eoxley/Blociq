Lease Lab is a comprehensive document analysis system for complex property documents (leases, scopes, assessments, reports) with OCR-first processing and detailed structured summaries.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Frontend Components**
- **`/lease-lab`** - Main page with upload panel and jobs list

- **`JobsList`** - Real-time job status with progress bars
- **`AnalysisDrawer`** - Detailed analysis viewer with tabbed interface

### **API Endpoints**
- **`POST /api/lease-lab/upload`** - File upload and job creation
- **`GET /api/lease-lab/jobs`** - Paginated jobs list
- **`GET /api/lease-lab/jobs/:id`** - Individual job details
- **`PATCH /api/lease-lab/jobs/:id`** - Attach job to building/unit

### **Database Schema**
- **`document_jobs`** table with RLS policies
- Status tracking: `QUEUED → OCR → EXTRACT → SUMMARISE → READY | FAILED`
- JSON storage for extracted data and summaries

## 🔧 **Key Features Implemented**

- Password protection detection (server-side)

### **2. Background Processing Pipeline**
- **QUEUED**: Job created, file uploaded
- **OCR**: Google Vision processing via Render service
- **EXTRACT**: Structure extraction (clauses, dates, parties, financials)
- **SUMMARISE**: AI-powered summarisation with source citations
- **READY**: Analysis complete, available for viewing

### **3. Analysis Interface**
- **Overview**: Document summary and parties
- **Clauses**: Extracted lease clauses with page references
- **Key Dates**: Important dates and deadlines
- **Financials**: Rent, deposits, charges, and costs
- **Obligations**: Tenant and landlord responsibilities
- **Restrictions**: Usage restrictions and limitations
- **Variations**: Document variations and amendments
- **Action Points**: Recommended follow-up actions

### **4. Integration Features**
- **Building/Unit Attachment**: Link analyses to specific properties
- **Ask BlocIQ Integration**: AI can read summary data for building queries
- **Export Functionality**: Download structured summaries
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh for processing jobs

## 🛡️ **Security & Validation**

### **Client-side Validation**
- File type checking
- Size validation
- User-friendly error messages

### **Server-side Validation**
- Tamper-proof validation
- Agency-based access control
- RLS policies for data isolation

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful failure states
- Detailed error messages
- Retry mechanisms

## 📊 **Data Flow**

```
1. User uploads file → Pre-flight validation
2. File uploaded to Supabase Storage
3. Job created in document_jobs table
4. Background worker processes via Render OCR
5. Structure extracted and summarised
6. Analysis available in drawer interface
7. Can be attached to building/unit
8. Ask BlocIQ can query summary data
```
