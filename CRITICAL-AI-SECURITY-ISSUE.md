# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL AI ASSISTANT SECURITY VULNERABILITY

## IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

**File**: `app/api/ask-assistant/route.ts`
**Issue**: AI Assistant can access and analyze data from ALL agencies
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Data breach through AI responses

## THE PROBLEM

The AI assistant endpoint has 9 data gathering functions that query the database WITHOUT agency filtering:

1. `gatherBuildingData()` - Accesses all buildings
2. `gatherUnitsData()` - Accesses all units
3. `gatherLeaseholdersData()` - Accesses all leaseholder data
4. `gatherComplianceData()` - Accesses all compliance data
5. `gatherEmailsData()` - Accesses all emails
6. `gatherTasksData()` - Accesses all tasks
7. `gatherDocumentsData()` - Accesses all documents
8. `gatherEventsData()` - Accesses all events
9. `gatherMajorWorksData()` - Accesses all major works data

## SECURITY IMPACT

- AI can analyze and respond with sensitive data from other agencies
- Users can potentially extract competitor information through clever prompts
- Complete data exposure across all agencies through AI responses
- Violates data protection and confidentiality requirements

## EXAMPLE VULNERABILITY

A user from Agency A could ask: "Tell me about all buildings managed by other agencies" and the AI would have access to that data and could potentially reveal it.

## REQUIRED FIX

Each gather function needs:
1. User session validation
2. User agency_id lookup
3. Agency filtering in all database queries

## COMPLEXITY

This is a complex fix requiring:
- 9 function updates
- Careful testing to ensure AI functionality isn't broken
- Verification that all data sources are properly filtered

## STATUS: CRITICAL - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE DECISION

Do you want this AI assistant vulnerability fixed immediately?
