# This is a placeholder for a sample PDF file
# In a real implementation, this would be a small PDF file (1-2 pages)
# containing a simple invoice or certificate for testing the document intake system

# The file should be small (< 100KB) and contain clear text that can be extracted
# Example content might include:
# - Invoice header
# - Company details
# - Date and invoice number
# - Line items
# - Total amount
# - Contact information

# For testing purposes, you can create a simple PDF using any PDF generator
# or download a sample invoice template and save it here.
