# Section 20 Consultation Threshold Calculator

## Overview

The Section 20 Consultation Threshold Calculator is a utility that helps property managers determine when formal consultation is required under Section 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. It calculates spending thresholds based on leaseholder apportionments for both residential-only and mixed-use buildings.

## Features

### üßÆ **UI Calculator** (`/tools/section-20-threshold`)

#### **Inputs**
- **Highest Residential Apportionment %** (required)
  - The highest percentage of service charge costs that any single residential leaseholder is responsible for
  - Range: 0.1% to 100%
- **Commercial Elements Toggle** (Yes/No)
  - Whether the building contains commercial units
- **Total Commercial %** (if commercial elements exist)
  - The percentage of service charge costs attributable to commercial units
  - Range: 0% to 100%

#### **Calculation Logic**

**Residential-Only Buildings:**
```
threshold = 250 / (highest_apportionment / 100)
```

**Mixed-Use Buildings:**
```
residential_pct = 100 - commercial_pct
threshold = (250 / (highest_apportionment / 100)) √ó (residential_pct / 100)
```

#### **Output**
- **Threshold Amount**: Formatted as currency (e.g., ¬£1,666.67)
- **Threshold Status**: Low/Standard threshold badge
- **Description**: Contextual advice based on threshold value
- **Calculation Details**: Step-by-step formula breakdown
- **Copy Result**: One-click copying to clipboard

### ü§ñ **AI Integration**

#### **Natural Language Queries**
The AI assistant can handle questions like:
- "What's the S20 threshold for these apportionments?"
- "Do I need to consult for ¬£10K works?"
- "Calculate the Section 20 threshold for a building with 15% highest apportionment"

#### **AI Processing**
1. **Detects Section 20 queries** using keyword matching
2. **Parses apportionment data** from text or uploaded spreadsheets
3. **Applies correct formula** (residential-only vs mixed-use)
4. **Provides guidance** on consultation requirements
5. **Suggests next steps** if consultation is needed

#### **Excel Upload Support**
- Accepts `.xlsx` files with apportionment data
- Calculates thresholds for all leaseholders
- Shows which leaseholders trigger the threshold
- Suggests appropriate letters if Section 20 is required

## API Endpoints

### **Calculate Section 20 Threshold**
**POST** `/api/calculate-section20`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "highestApportionment": 15.5,
  "hasCommercial": true,
  "commercialPercentage": 40,
  "worksValue": 5000
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "threshold": 1666.67,
    "isResidentialOnly": false,
    "residentialPercentage": 60,
    "commercialPercentage": 40,
    "highestApportionment": 15.5,
    "requiresConsultation": true,
    "description": "This means any qualifying works above this value will require formal consultation under Section 20.\n\nüî¥ CONSULTATION REQUIRED: The proposed works value of ¬£5,000 exceeds the threshold of ¬£1,667. You must follow the Section 20 consultation process.",
    "calculation": "(¬£250 √∑ (15.5% √∑ 100)) √ó (60% √∑ 100) = ¬£1,666.67"
  }
}
```

## Legal Context

### **Section 20 Requirements**
- **Threshold**: ¬£250 per leaseholder (not per building)
- **Scope**: Qualifying works that cost any leaseholder more than ¬£250
- **Process**: Three-stage consultation process required
- **Mixed-use**: Only residential leaseholders are considered

### **When Consultation is Required**
- Major works or improvements
- Works exceeding the calculated threshold
- Service charge costs above threshold per leaseholder
- Qualifying long-term agreements

### **When Consultation is NOT Required**
- Routine maintenance below threshold
- Emergency works
- Works below the calculated threshold
- Non-qualifying works

## Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Residential-Only Building**
```
Input:
- Highest apportionment: 10%
- Commercial elements: No

Calculation:
threshold = 250 / (10 / 100) = ¬£2,500

Result:
‚úÖ No consultation required for works under ¬£2,500
```

### **Example 2: Mixed-Use Building**
```
Input:
- Highest apportionment: 15%
- Commercial elements: Yes
- Commercial percentage: 40%

Calculation:
residential_pct = 100 - 40 = 60%
threshold = (250 / (15 / 100)) √ó (60 / 100) = ¬£1,000

Result:
‚úÖ No consultation required for works under ¬£1,000
```

### **Example 3: Low Threshold Warning**
```
Input:
- Highest apportionment: 50%
- Commercial elements: No

Calculation:
threshold = 250 / (50 / 100) = ¬£500

Result:
‚ö†Ô∏è Low threshold - consider reviewing lease terms
```
