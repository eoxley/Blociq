## Troubleshooting

### "Column not found" error

- Check you didn't accidentally change the header row

### "Foreign key violation" error
- You uploaded sheets in the wrong order
- Make sure building_name matches exactly between sheets
- Buildings must be uploaded before units
- Units must be uploaded before leaseholders

### "Duplicate key" error
- You're trying to upload the same data twice
- Check if the data already exists in the table
